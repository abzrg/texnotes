\chapter{The Finite Difference Method (FDM)}

This method is the oldest method for numerical solution of the PDEs,
and it is believed to be introduced by Euler in the 18th century.
The basic concept of FDM is to use Taylor Series expansions to obtain an approximations to the derivatives of the variables that appear in the PDE.
However the first step is to discretize the domain by defining a numerical \textbf{grid} (or a \textbf{mesh}).
